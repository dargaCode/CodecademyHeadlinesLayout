# Headlines Page Layout
<strong>Language: HTML/CSS</strong>

My first totally-from-scratch, no-bootstrap webpage, and the first where I’ve worked in source control from the beginning.

I made some changes from <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/projects/headlines/index.html">the design they provided</a>, and also spent a lot of time to make sure the site was nice and responsive.

I’ve been wanting to do a project with no bootstrap, and I was pleasantly surprised how easy the columns ended up being.
